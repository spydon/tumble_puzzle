# TumblePuzzle

A normal slide puzzle.
You are playing as a computer scientist and just like in reality the first thing you do is to break
the frame so that you can organize the blocks as you wish, since you know that this can be done in a
much better time complexity than tediously sliding around the blocks inside of the frame. 

Computer scientist: Breaking the rules to get O(n) instead of O(nÂ²)? Totally worth it!

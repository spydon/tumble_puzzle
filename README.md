# TumblePuzzle

You are a crazy scientist god solving a slider puzzle in space. 
Since you are a god, some rules can be bent, it doesn't necessarily make it
easier though...


## Instructions

Pull the blocks like in a normal slide puzzle, it sounds easy, but everything
is affected by physics and even though you can bend the rules by clicking the
buttons, it is not as easy as it looks.

The blocks don't have to have the correct angle for you to win (they can be
upside-down for example), as long as they go from 1 to 15 in a square.


## About

This game was created for the Flutter Puzzle Hack 2022 with the use of the
Flame game engine and Forge2D for the physics.
